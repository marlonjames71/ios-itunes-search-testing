/*
Dependencies:
- URL Session
- ResultType
- URL
- URLRequest
-searchTerm
- URLQueryItems

What are tests that we can create?
- Are we decoding the onject properly?
- Are we constructing the URL correctly?
- SearchResults Array is not empty after search
- empty? Nothing to return / something was
- Fails elegantly with bad data
- Is our completion handler is always called?
- Feature: provide
